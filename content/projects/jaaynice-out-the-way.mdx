So, here's the lowdown on how it all went down. We huddled up in our music engineering playground here at ONEX Records, fueled by passion and a whole lot of coffee. Our team of musical wizards, producers, and Jaaynice himself, put their creative minds together, and boom, "Out The Way" was born!

We're not just talking about any old track here, folks. This one's got soul, it's got groove, and it's got that special something that will make you hit the replay button over and over again. Our engineers worked their magic, using the latest tech and some serious skills to make sure every beat, every lyric, and every note hit you just right.

Collaboration is the name of the game, and let me tell you, the energy in that studio was off the charts. Jaaynice brought his A-game, and our ONEX team added that sprinkle of magic sauce. The result? "Out The Way" is a musical journey you won't forget. From the first note to the last beat, it's a vibe that'll have you nodding your head and tapping your feet.
